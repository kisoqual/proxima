# Proxima Disperser


this preset plugin makes your kicks
and other transients more punchy 

it uses MFreeformPhase by default 
but you can put other disperser whatever you want 

turn or automate both knobs to crossfade between signal states 
or you can use a Crossfade Limiter and also use this in stock! 
because hes have it right in away 

and you can also put this on the master lul 

more improvments will be still updating
